/**
 * PM2 ecosystem file — persists process config + environment across pm2
 * daemon restarts and server reboots.
 *
 * Usage on the deployment host:
 *   cd hirestream/
 *   pm2 startOrReload ecosystem.config.cjs        # apply
 *   pm2 save                                       # persist for daemon restart
 *
 * Only includes background cron processes. The main `hirestream` web server
 * is intentionally NOT listed here because its deploy path is via
 * `scripts/deploy-gate.sh` (which runs deep-smoke before pm2 restart). Adding
 * it here would create two control planes for the same process — bad. Keep
 * the deploy gate as the sole entry point for the web server.
